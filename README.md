JFreeChart extension
==========

The eXist-db [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) extension has been part of the eXist-db distribution for a long time, but due to the size of the third party libraries it hasn't been enabled by default. 

This project provides two XAR files:
- a XAR file containing all required java libraries files 
- a compact Showcase XAR.

The XAR file is shipped with [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) version *1.0.17* and Apache [Batik SVG Toolkit](https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/) version *1.7*.

Installable XAR files are available on the [releases](../../releases) page. Contributions are welcome via [Pull requests](../../pulls); bugreports, ideas and suggestions can be filed using the [Issues](../../issues) page.


Some documentation can be found on the wiki of the [JFreeChart extension](https://github.com/eXist-db/jfreechart/wiki).
